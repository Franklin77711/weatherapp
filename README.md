----------Weather Application----------

A simple weather app with a use of Open Weather API.
You can search for a city and get the current temperature, what it feels like and a picture about the weather.
You recive a 4 day forcast as well.
You can switch between Celcius and Fahrenheit.
Added animation so it slides in either from the top or side depending on you device.
The background images is changing depending what time is you on

------future ideas------
need to fix to get the the wanted city if there are 2 of them in the world
cleaner code
use the avarage temperature in the forcast(currently it only show what will happen the middle of the day)
